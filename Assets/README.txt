EASY MARKETING IN UNITY
--------------------------------------------
Easy Marketing in Unity is a plugin which allows users to post to multiple Social Media Sites from within the Unity Editor.
The goal of this plugin is to enable more developers to market their games more.

Easy Marketing in Unity is NOT a replacement for these sites

WHAT IT CONTAINS
--------------------------------------------
Easy Marketing In Unity comes with 4 folders
* Editor is responsible for all the code. You can look at it for inspiration, but it probably won't help.
* Save contains Server Data, Preferences, and Log Information
* Plugins contains all the external data. This includes the DLL and Server. I'd advise not touching this folder.
* Textures contains all the textures used in the Plugin.

See the Help window for More Info.

HOW IT WORKS
--------------------------------------------
Easy Marketing In Unity uses 3 components Unity, DLL, and the Server
* Unity allows for displaying UI and receiving User Interaction.
* The DLL acts as a medium for interacting with the Server.
* The Server allows users to perform API calls to each site.

See the Help window for More Info.
