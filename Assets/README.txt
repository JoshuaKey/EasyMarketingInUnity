ERRORS
--------------------------------------------
If you get "Opening File ... The process can not access the file because it is being used by another process."
Just hit Cancel. Unity is being a baby because it can't access the file.
--------------------------------------------

FOLDERS
--------------------------------------------
Easy Marketing In Unity comes with 4 folders

Editor is responsible for all the code. You can look at it for inspiration, but it probably won't help.

Save contains Server Data, Preferences, and Log Information

Plugins contains all the external data. This includes the DLL and Server. I'd advise not touching this folder.

Textures contains all the textures used in the Plugin.
