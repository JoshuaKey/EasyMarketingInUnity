# Easy Marketing in Unity
Easy Marketing in Unity is a plugin which allows users to post to multiple Social Media Sites from within the Unity Editor. 
The goal of this plugin is to enable more developers to market their games more.

Easy Marketing in Unity is **NOT** a replacement for these sites

## What it Contains
Easy Marketing In Unity comes with 4 folders

* **Editor** is responsible for all the code. You can look at it for inspiration, but it probably won't help.
* **Save** contains Server Data, Preferences, and Log Information
* **Plugins** contains all the external data. This includes the DLL and Server. I'd advise not touching this folder.
* **Textures** contains all the textures used in the Plugin.

See the Help window for More Info.

## How it Works
Easy Marketing In Unity uses 3 components **Unity**, **DLL**, and the **Server**
* **Unity** allows for displaying UI and receiving User Interaction.
* The **DLL** acts as a medium for interacting with the Server.
* The **Server** allows users to perform API calls to each site.
